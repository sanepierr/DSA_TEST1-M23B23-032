## Description

This Python code accomplishes the following tasks:

1. Creates two separate lists, `catholic_martyrs` and `anglican_martyrs`, containing the names of Catholic and Anglican martyrs, respectively.
2. Identifies and removes any duplicate names present in both lists.
3. Defines a function, `martyr_count`, that takes a martyr's name as an argument and returns the group (Catholic or Anglican) to which the martyr belongs.
4. Determines the group of the martyr named "Kizito" using the `martyr_count` function.
5. Provides a function, `is_uganda_martyr`, which returns `True` if an input string matches the names of Uganda Martyrs in both lists.
6. Demonstrates how to use the `is_uganda_martyr` function to check if a name is a Uganda Martyr.
